Tired of sending your minions on missions and spending days prestiging a level 100 White Knight just to farm Divinity Points (DP)?

Then I'm here to help you once and for all!

With Enhanced_Divinities, you can configure your settings to either max the level of the prestiging minion or a custom level!

*(This may affect the user experience.)*

This patch modifies the prestige action, alterating your minionâ€™s level, allowing you to obtain thousands of DP effortlessly.
